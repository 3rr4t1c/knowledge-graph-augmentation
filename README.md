Files content:

- `main/ComplEx/proof_Lector.py` contains main implementation as a function;
- `main/ComplEx/stub_Lector.py` define an object to simulate Lector behaviour extended with some new stuff;
- `main/ComplEx/proof_Lector_tools.py` define some functions useful to simulate Lector structures and misc;
